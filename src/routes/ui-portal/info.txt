about the bills
---

i have discovered a mistake in my spreadsheet: i found ~$500 hidden in my monthly bills

THEREFORE
we have more money than i was calculating... i was wrong!

i absolutely cannot share this information, i must keep it hidden, i need to make it a suprise

no more open-sharing about the finances, i have created the impression of debt
AND THEREFORE
have significantly reduced the spending

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
this is great news because that means that we can create a stockpile and not run out of money!!!
